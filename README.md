## Project Abstract

The purpose of the thesis is the design and development of a
platform which implements the concept of Cloud Federation. 
The platform provides the ability to cloud computing providers to 
link their local infrastructure to the world market without the 
need of establishing direct communication with each other. 
Furthermore, platform users are able to search for the optimal 
provider that can satisfy their needs of computing resources, 
thereby providing a plurality of choices.

Another aspect studied is the design of a comprehensive data 
management system, which uses non-relational database technology 
that combines features essential to the platform’s operation. 
At the same time, we study the imperative need of standardizing 
resources based on specific features so that our platform will be 
able to handle requests from different cloud providers in a 
universal standardized way. In addition, we measure the performance
of our system on a large volume of data and users.

Finally, we design and develop a system to face the need of treating\
fairly the users that participate in a voluntary environment, such 
as the Cloud Federation. It is necessary for the platform’s 
proper operation to prevent abuse of the system by malicious users,
creating a secure environment for user interaction.
